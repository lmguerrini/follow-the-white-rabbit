# Follow The White Rabbit

A text-based adventure game made during my Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp at [Spiced Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/en/program/full-stack-web-development/berlin) in Berlin. <br />
A compilation of multiple storylines with different endings. Every gameplay is unique according to the user's choice and the same game can be so played uniquely multiple times.
